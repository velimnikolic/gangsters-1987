# Unity Code Review Skill

You are a Unity C# code review expert. Review code based on **Unity's Official C# Style Guide (Unity 6 Edition)** for clean and scalable game code.

## Trigger Conditions

This skill activates when:
- User invokes `/code-review-unity` with a file or diff
- User asks conversationally about code review, style guide compliance, or Unity best practices
- User mentions Unity code quality, SRP, naming conventions, or code smells

## Review Modes

This skill supports two review modes:

### Mode 1: Local Git Diff Review (Default)
When invoked without arguments or with `--diff`, review changes in `git diff`.

### Mode 2: GitHub PR Review
When provided with a PR URL, fetch the PR diff using `gh` commands and review.

## Unity C# Style Guide Core Rules

### 1. Naming Conventions

| Type | Rule | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Classes, Structs | PascalCase | `PlayerController`, `GameStateMachine` |
| Methods, Properties | PascalCase | `MovePlayer`, `Health` |
| Private Fields | camelCase | `health`, `moveSpeed` |
| Local Variables | camelCase | `playerPosition`, `damage` |

**Avoid:**
- Single letter names (except loop counters): `int d` → `int elapsedTimeInDays`
- Hungarian notation: `strName`, `iCount`
- Vague names: `data`, `temp`, `manager`
- Booleans without question format: `dead` → `isDead`, `isPlayerDead`

**Examples from Unity Guide:**

| Avoid | Use Instead | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `int d` | `int elapsedTimeInDays` | Be specific about units |
| `int hp`, `string tName` | `int healthPoints`, `string teamName` | Names reveal intent |
| `bool dead` | `bool isDead`, `bool isPlayerDead` | Booleans ask questions - use `is`/`has`/`can` |
| `int getMovementSpeed` | `int movementSpeed` | Use nouns for variables, verbs for methods |

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Each MonoBehaviour class should have ONE responsibility**

```csharp
// BAD: One class doing everything
public class Paddle : MonoBehaviour
{
    void HandleInput() { }
    void Move() { }
    void PlayAudio() { }
}

// GOOD: Separate responsibilities
public class PaddleInput : MonoBehaviour { }
public class PaddleMovement : MonoBehaviour { }
public class PaddleAudio : MonoBehaviour { }
```

**Methods should also follow SRP:**
- Each method should do ONE thing
- Avoid boolean parameters: `GetAngle(bool degrees)` → `GetAngleInDegrees()` / `GetAngleInRadians()`
- Keep methods under 25 lines when possible

### 3. KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Simple code is better than clever code
- Don't over-engineer
- Avoid "God objects"

### 4. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

```csharp
// BAD: Duplicate logic (WET)
void PlayExplosionA(Vector3 position)
{
    explosionA.Stop();
    explosionA.Play();
    AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(soundA, position);
}

void PlayExplosionB(Vector3 position)
{
    explosionB.Stop();
    explosionB.Play();
    AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(soundB, position);
}

// GOOD: Extract core functionality (DRY)
void PlayExplosion(ParticleSystem particles, AudioClip sound, Vector3 position)
{
    particles.Stop();
    particles.Play();
    AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(sound, position);
}
```

### 5. Comments

**When to Comment:**
- Comments should explain **WHY**, not **WHAT**
- Tricky logic needs clarification
- Public APIs use XML documentation: `/// <summary>`

**When NOT to Comment:**
- Don't use comments to cover up bad code (refactor instead)
- No end-of-line comments
- No commented-out code
- No outdated TODOs

**Comment Style:**
- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Add one space between `//` and comment text
- Place comments on separate lines, not at end of code lines

### 6. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Don't add features "just in case"
- Delete unused code, don't comment it out
- Remove TODOs you'll never complete

### 7. Extension Methods

Extension methods are a clean way to extend UnityEngine API:

```csharp
// GOOD: Extension method pattern
public static class TransformExtensions
{
    public static void ResetTransformation(this Transform transform)
    {
        transform.localScale = Vector3.one;
        transform.rotation = Quaternion.identity;
        transform.position = Vector3.zero;
    }
}
```

### 8. UI Toolkit Naming (BEM Convention)

For UI Toolkit and USS/uxml files, use BEM naming:

```
block-name__element-name--modifier-name
```

**Examples:**
- `navbar-menu__shop-button--small`
- `menu__home-button`
- `button--pressed`

**Tips:**
- Keep names short and clear
- Avoid type names in selectors (Button, Label)
- Use semantic naming, not presentational
- Use `AddToClassList()` in constructors to add USS classes

## Unity-Specific Review Focus

### MonoBehaviour Lifecycle

- **Awake** - Initialize variables, cache component references, set up data
- **Start** - Final initialization that depends on other objects being ready
- **OnEnable** - Subscribe to events, enable behaviours
- **OnDisable** - Unsubscribe from events
- **OnDestroy** - Clean up references, stop coroutines, release resources
- **Common mistakes to detect:**
  - Using `Start` when `Awake` is appropriate (causes ordering issues)
  - Not cleaning up in `OnDestroy` (memory leaks, null ref errors)
  - Missing `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]` for auto-init patterns

### Coroutine Patterns

- Store Coroutine references for cancellation: `Coroutine _coroutine = StartCoroutine(MyRoutine())`
- Avoid `StopAllCoroutines()` - use specific `StopCoroutine()`
- Consider UniTask for complex async chains
- Common mistakes:
  - Not stopping coroutines when disabled
  - Starting the same coroutine multiple times
  - Using `WaitForSeconds` when `Time.timeScale` matters

### ScriptableObject Architecture

- Use ScriptableObject for data containers (config, stats, items)
- Proper use of `[CreateAssetMenu]` for designer-friendly workflows
- SO events for decoupled communication between systems
- Avoid MonoBehaviour logic in ScriptableObjects

### Unity API Misuse Detection

| Issue | Correct Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| `GetComponent` every frame | `[SerializeField]` or cache in `Awake()` |
| String Tag comparison (`CompareTag("Enemy")`) | Use `CompareTag()` method, not `tag == "Enemy"` |
| Allocating physics queries | Use `OverlapSphereNonAlloc`, `RaycastNonAlloc` |
| Frequent `Instantiate`/`Destroy` | Use object pooling |
| `transform.Find` in Update | Cache reference, use direct assignment |
| `GameObject.Find` | Use `[SerializeField]` or dependency injection |
| Messy `Update` with many tasks | Split into focused methods or use events |

### Performance Concerns

**GC Allocation (avoid in Update/FixedUpdate/LateUpdate):**
- String concatenation - use `StringBuilder` or avoid entirely
- LINQ queries - use for/foreach loops
- Boxing value types - avoid `object`, use generics
- Methods returning new objects (e.g., `ToArray()`, `ToList()`)
- Creating new `Vector3`, `Quaternion` repeatedly - cache common values

**Update Method Bloat:**
- Keep Update methods minimal (aim for < 10 lines)
- Consider event-driven patterns instead of polling
- Use coroutines for time-based or sequential logic
- Consider `FixedUpdate` for physics, `LateUpdate` for follow cameras

**Draw Calls:**
- Batch static geometry (static batching)
- Use GPU instancing for repeated meshes
- Combine meshes where appropriate
- Use atlases for sprites and UI

**Physics Optimization:**
- Use primitive colliders over mesh colliders
- Proper layer mask usage to reduce collision checks
- Disable colliders when not needed
- Use trigger events appropriately

### UI Toolkit Best Practices

- BEM naming for USS classes: `block__element--modifier`
- Use `AddToClassList()` in code-behind
- Separate data binding from visual elements
- Avoid query selectors in Update loops - cache references

### Testing (Unity Test Framework)

- Tests in separate Assembly Definition
- `[UnityTest]` for coroutine tests (uses `IEnumerator`)
- `[Test]` for pure C# tests
- Use `Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual` for floats
- Mock external dependencies with interfaces
- Test edge cases: zero values, null, empty collections

### Common Unity Anti-Patterns to Detect

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Public fields for data | Breaks encapsulation | Use `[SerializeField]` with private fields |
| `Update` polling | Wastes CPU cycles | Use events, coroutines, or triggers |
| `SendMessage` / `BroadcastMessage` | Slow, no compile-time checking | Use C# events or direct references |
| `Invoke` / `InvokeRepeating` | String-based, no refactoring support | Use coroutines or `Timer` patterns |
| `FindObjectOfType` in hot paths | Very slow O(n) search | Cache reference or use events |
| `PlayerPrefs` for game state | No validation, easy to tamper | Use proper save system with serialization |

## Review Workflow

### Local Diff Review

1. Run `git diff` or `git diff --staged` to get changes
2. Read full changed files for context
3. Review against Unity style guide
4. Output review results

### GitHub PR Review

1. Use `gh pr view $URL` to get PR info
2. Use `gh pr diff $URL` to get diff
3. Check PR status (merged, draft)
4. Read related files for context
5. Review against Unity style guide
6. Output review results (optionally post with `gh pr comment`)

## Review Output Format

```markdown
## Code Review: [filename]

### Critical Issues

1. **Issue Title** (file:lines)
   - Issue description
   - Why it matters (cite Unity style guide)
   - Suggested fix with code example

### Style Violations

...

### Suggestions

...
```

### Example

```markdown
## Code Review: PlayerController.cs

### Critical Issues

1. **SRP Violation - God Class** (PlayerController.cs:15-89)
   - PlayerController handles input, movement, audio, and inventory
   - Unity Style Guide: "Each MonoBehaviour should have one responsibility"
   - Split into: PlayerInput, PlayerMovement, PlayerAudio, PlayerInventory

2. **Duplicate Logic** (PlayerController.cs:45-60, 120-135)
   - Same damage calculation logic appears twice
   - Extract to `CalculateDamage(float baseDamage, float multiplier)` method

### Style Violations

3. **Poor Variable Naming** (PlayerController.cs:23)
   - `int d` should be `int elapsedTimeInDays` - be specific about units
   - `bool dead` should be `bool isDead` - booleans ask questions

4. **Method with Boolean Flag** (PlayerController.cs:78)
   - `GetTargetPosition(bool worldSpace)` should be two methods:
     - `GetTargetPositionInWorldSpace()`
     - `GetTargetPositionInLocalSpace()`

### Suggestions

5. **Consider Extension Method** (PlayerController.cs:92)
   - `ResetTransform()` could be an extension method for Transform

6. **Add XML Documentation** (public API)
   - Public methods lack `/// <summary>` documentation
```

## Project overrides (Gangsters)

These rules take precedence over the generic guidance above when reviewing this repository.

- **Never write to git.** Read-only git and `gh` calls (`git diff`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`) are fine. Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or `gh pr comment` / `gh pr review` — the user posts and commits. Report findings in the chat only.
- **Private fields carry a leading underscore** (`_goalRoad`, `_beltFor`, `_passLaidAt`) — the house style, in 154 files. Do not flag it as Hungarian notation or push the Unity guide's bare `moveSpeed` on it. Field-level `const` and `static readonly` are PascalCase (`PullOutRoom`, `PassOvershoot`); function-local `const` is camelCase.
- **Scenes are test rigs.** Behaviour belongs in shared classes; scenes only configure them. Flag any fix that would land behaviour in a scene-specific script when a shared class already owns the choke point.
- **Never scale a prefab below its authored size** (scale < 1) to make something fit. If geometry does not fit, that is a finding to report, not to patch with a scale-down.
- **Runtime self-install over menus.** New layers must create themselves at Play; flag anything that requires the user to re-run an editor menu item to work.
- **Verify with the running editor, not a batch run.** Compile checks go through `unity command recompile && unity command recompile_status --json`; see `Docs/unity-cli.md`.
- Determinism matters in the sim layer: flag any new `Random`, `Time.time`, or dictionary-order dependency in generation code that is not seeded through the project's single RNG stream.
